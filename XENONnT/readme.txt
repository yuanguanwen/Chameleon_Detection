Those files contain data from Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 161805 (2022), "Search for New Physics in Electronic Recoil Data from XENONnT" and are made available by the XENON Collaboration. The explanation of each file is detailed below in the order of file names.

"bdm_limits.txt" contains the limits of bosonic dark matter, including dark photon and alps, from 1 to 140 keV/c2 as shown in the lower panel of Fig. 6. Inside the file, the first column is the mass in keV/c2, the second column is the 90% C.L. upper limit of the axion-electron coupling g_ae, and the third column is the 90% C.L. upper limit of the kinetic mixing parameter kappa for dark photon. Both g_ae and kappa are dimensionless.

"bkg_model.txt" contains the best-fit background model B0 below 30 keV, illustrated in Fig. 5. Inside the file, the first column represents the reconstructed electronic recoil energy in keV, and the second column means the background rate in the unit of events/(tonne year keV).

"data_unbinned_1to30kev.txt" includes the reconstructed energies of the ER events under 30 keV passing all the cuts, i.e. unbinned data below 30 keV in Fig. 5. The total number of events is 433. Inside the file, the values are event energies in keV.

"efficiency.txt" includes the total efficiency shown in Fig. 1. Inside the file, the first column is the reconstructed recoil energy in keV and the second column is the total efficiency.
